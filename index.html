            The current system of the American presidential elections uses the Electoral College which delegates
            points per state. If a candidate wins majority of voters in that state, all the state's points are
            awarded to the candidate.

            Although Trump has won the most counties and it seems like Trump has won by a landslide, but every
            county has skewed populations. Los Angeles County in California has roughly 10 million people,
            which is an incredible difference to Loving County in Texas with 169 people.

    <h1 id="statePopulationHeader">Winning by state population density</h1>

        <p id="statePopulationText">
            To estimate this, we will use Australia's voting system.

            Each electorate/county represents 50,000 people and winning majority in an electorate/county awards
            one point. Since USA's counties have skewed populations, then instead we will consider the entire
            state's population and award points per 50,000 people.
