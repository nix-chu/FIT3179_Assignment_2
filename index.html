        <p class="electoralCollegeText">
            The current system of the American presidential elections uses the Electoral College which delegates
            points per state. If a candidate wins majority of voters in that state, all the state's points are
            awarded to the candidate, in other words: 'winner takes all'. The winner is decided once a candidate earns more than half of the available
            points. 
        </p>
        <p class="electoralCollegeText">
            With this system, <span class="biden">Biden</span> won comfortably with 306 points.

    <h1 id="popularVoteHeader">Winning by popular vote</h1>
    <div class=float-container>
        <div id="popularVoteChart"></div>
        <p class="popularVoteText">It is commonly debated that the presidential elections should be determined
            by popular vote, because it is simpler to understand and represents the choice of the people. Whereas
            swing states and large states receive more favors due to the Electoral College's 'winner takes all'
            system.
        </p>
        <p class="popularVoteText">
            As we can see <span class="biden">Biden</span> wins this scenario by 8 million votes.
        </p>

    <div class=float-container>
        <h1 id="countyVoteHeader">Winning by number of counties won</h1>
        <div id="countyVoteMap"></div>
        <p class="countyVoteText">
            This unfairness is clearly shown in this choropleth map, where <span class="trump">Trump</span> 
            seemingly won the most counties. Although <span class="trump">Trump</span> has won the most counties 
            and has won by a landslide, but every county has different populations. Los Angeles County in 
            California has roughly 10 million people, which is an incredible difference to Loving County in 
            Texas with 169 people.
        </p>
        <p class="countyVoteText">
            Through this system, <span class="trump">Trump</span> crushes <span class="biden">Biden</span> by 
            more than 2000 counties.
        </p>
        <div id="countyVotePadding"></div>
    </div>

    <h1 id="statePopulationHeader">Winning by state population density</h1>
    <div class=float-container>
        <p class="statePopulationText">
            To balance the discrepancy between counties, we will instead consider the population density per
            state. This should not only balance each state, but also the winner should receive the most
            popular vote.
        </p>
        <p class="statePopulationText">
            To estimate this, we will use Australia's voting system. Each electorate/county represents 50,000
            people and winning majority in an electorate/county awards one point. Since USA's counties have
            skewed populations, then instead we will consider the entire state's population and award points
            per 50,000 people. Then the winner will be decided based on majority of points earned.
        </p>
        <p class="statePopulationText">
            As a result, <span class="biden">Biden</span> wins this scenario around 150 point more than 
            <span class="trump">Trump</span>.
