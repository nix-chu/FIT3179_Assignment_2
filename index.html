    <h1>Winning by Electoral Colleges</h1>
    <div id="electoralCollegeMap"></div>

    <h1>Winning by popular vote</h1>
    <div id="popularVoteChart"></div>

    <h1>Winning by number of counties won</h1>
    <div id="countyVoteMap"></div>
    <p>
        Although Trump has won the most counties and it seems like Trump has won by a landslide, but every
        county has skewed populations. Los Angeles County in California has roughly 10 million people,
        which is an incredible difference to Loving County in Texas with 169 people.

    <h1>Winning by state population density</h1>
    <p>
        To estimate this, we will use Australia's voting system.

        Each electorate/county represents 50,000 people and winning majority in an electorate/county awards
        one point. Since USA's counties have skewed populations, then instead we will consider the entire
        state's population and award points per 50,000 people.
